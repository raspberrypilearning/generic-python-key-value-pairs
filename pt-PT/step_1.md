Here is a dictionary of band members. The **key** is the first part (e.g. 'john'), and its associated **value** is the second part (e.g. 'rhythm guitar').

```python
band = {
  'john' : 'rhythm guitar',
  'paul' : 'bass guitar',
  'george' : 'lead guitar',
  'ringo' : 'bass guitar'
    }
```

Here's how to add a key:value pair to the dictionary:

```python
# Add a key:value pair
band['yoko'] = 'vocals'
```

Here's how to remove a key:value pair from the dictionary:

```python
# Remove a key:value pair
del band['paul']
```
