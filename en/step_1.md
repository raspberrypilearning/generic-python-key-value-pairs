You can add and remove items from a dictionary quite easily. For instance, here is a simple dictionary.

```python
band = {
    'john' : 'rhythm guitar',
    'paul' : 'base guitar',
	'george' : 'lead guitar',
    'ringo' : 'base guitar'
	}
```

You can do the following to add a key:value pairs to the dictionary.

```python
## adding key:value pairs
band['yoko'] = 'vocals'
```

If you want to remove a key:value pair you can do the following.
```python
## removing key:value pairs
del band['paul']
```
